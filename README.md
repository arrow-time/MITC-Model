# MITC Model

## Multiplicative-Entropy-Driven Invariant-Topology Two-Layer Chiral-Space (MITC) Model Introduction

The MITC model, standing for Multiplicative-Entropy-Driven Invariant-Topology Chiral-Space model, is a theoretical framework designed to unify general relativity and quantum field theory through a novel two-layer structure of spacetime. 

A defining feature of the MITC model is its treatment of entropy not as a sum over states, but as a multiplicative function of energy distributions across fundamental spacetime units called Space Elementary Quanta. This multiplicative form allows for a high resolution representation of time evolution, where each moment corresponds to the update of the quantum network's energy redistribution. In this way, the increase of entropy becomes directly linked to the forward progression of time, offering a clear physical picture of irreversibility rooted in microscopic changes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a two-layer fiber bundle space model where spacetime is composed of Planck-scale discrete units -Space Elementary Quanta (SEQ) and Sub-Planck-scale elastic substrate. (i)Time emerges from irreversible state transitions of the SEQ network, with each step corresponding to a calculable entropy(S=∏mᵢ, i∈N) from transformation matrices governing spatial changes. (ii) Matter itself is a manifestation of compressed space: SU(3) symmetry mediates local SEQ compression, storing energy as mass while stretching surrounding space to generate gravity. The Higgs field stabilizes compressed regions via symmetry breaking, acting as a "quantum lock". (iii)This model explains why time slows near massive objects—local deformed SEQ network undergo fewer state transitions frequency. (iv)The model makes testable predictions, including a chiral asymmetry in electron-positron magnetic moments due to their distinct coupling to the chirality-fixed-spin SEQ ground state. (v)It also resolves black hole singularities by imposing an upper limit on SEQ tension. (vi)By establishing a correspondence between metric-scale geometry and quantum resonant frequencies, an alternative framework is presented.(vii) By treating spacetime as a dynamic quantized-elastic network, this framework bridges general relativity, quantum field theory, and thermodynamics. (viii)A GR Reformulation of Electromagnetic Interactions within the Quantum Elastic Spacetime Framework. (ix)This work presents a physical picture that accounts for the initial low entropy, the generation of matter and dark matter, and the observed anomalies in galaxy rotation curves during the early cosmic stage. (x) Degrees of Freedom in the Future and The essence of life in This Model.  (xi)This model sets the resonant frequency and resonant axis vector of SEQ as two generalized coordinates in Hamiltonian formalism with the fundamental assumption of invariant spatial topology, naturally yielding global energy conservation and simplifying the Hamiltonian formulation of the system. The Hamiltonian in this model represents a snapshot of the spatial energy distribution, whose configuration inherently encodes all possible evolutionary paths of the next state under constraints such as energy conduction rules, energy conservation, entropy increase, and maximum entropy path selection. (xii) Crucially, the framework offers mechanistic explanations for a broad spectrum of quantum and relativistic phenomena. It provides intuitive physical pictures for the non-additivity of the speed of light, wave-particle duality, the uncertainty principle, parity non-conservation, the electron's 1/2 spin, the neutron electric dipole moment problem, the fractional charge of quarks, the nature of energy in nuclear reactions, muon decay, the Structural Origins of Fermion Generations and Neutrino oscillation. (xiii)This model explains quantum entanglement through global energy conservation while preserving local causality.
